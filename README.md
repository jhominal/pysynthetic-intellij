# PySynthetic plugin for IntelliJ and PyCharm

This project provides an IntelliJ plugin that assists in the usage of classes using members generated by the
[`PySynthetic`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysynthetic) library.

The goal of this plugin is to provide:

 * Auto-completion of the names of generated members when using PySynthetic-using types;
 * Type information for the generated members, if available (via the use of `contract`);
 * Initializer editing assistance;
